    <h1>My Books</h1>

    <p>
      Fun fact about me: I write, edit, and self-publish books! I started
      self-publishing when I was 25 and completed my first short story
      collection in 2022.
    </p>

    <p>I loved writing when I was a kid.</p>
    The Moonlight Thrills Series is a paranormal romance series with a dash of
    thrills (See what I did there?). Each book can be read as a standalone, but
    it's best to read them in order because some characters make appearances in
    other stories. Meryle and Lancelot's Adventures is a reimagining of the
    Arthurian legends. Meryle Evanders, Merlin's cousin, is the main protagonist
    of the story. There is a slow-burn romance between the main characters and
    (of course) magical adventures! All of my eBooks are free. They're available
    on: Apple Barnes & Noble Kobo Kobo Plus Scribd Thalia Mondadori Vivlio
    Overdrive (for libraries) Palace Marketplace (for libraries) Even if you're
    not a fan of romance, fantasy, or the paranormal genre, give my books a try!
    You might find yourself getting lost in a moonlit adventure or wondering
    what Merlin's end goal is for Meryle and Lancelot... **Click on each book
