    <h1>My Books</h1>

    <h3>
      Fun fact about me: I write, edit, and self-publish books! I started
      self-publishing when I was 25 and completed my first short story
      collection in 2022.
    </h3>

    <p>
      The Moonlight Thrills Series is a paranormal romance series set in a world
      where magical species (werewolves, vampires, fairies, wizards, etc.)
      publicly coexist with humans. Each book can be read as a standalone, but
      it's best to read them in order because some characters make appearances
      in other stories.

    <p>
      Meryle and Lancelot's Adventures is a short story series that reimagines
      the Arthurian legends. Join Meryle Evanders, Merlin's cousin, and Lancelot
      as they undertake magical quests, fall in love, and discover Merlin's plan
      for Camelot.
